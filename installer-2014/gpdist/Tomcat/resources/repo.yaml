#
# Module Repository details are configured in this file in YAML format.
#
# Each entry (aka yaml document) in this list will be displayed in the module chooser 
# drop-down on the 'Install from repository' page.
#
# Entries (aka documents) are delimited by the '---' separator at the start of a line.
#
# To add additional repositories to the menu, create a new 'repo_custom.yaml' file
# and include it in the resources directory.
# This (repo.yaml) file will be replaced if/when you update your GP server.
#
# You can also add repositories from the Server Settings -> Repositories page.
#
# To include details such as a label, icon, brief description, and full description
# for a custom module repository. These are steps to take in the repository web application
# not this GP server
#
# 1) create an about folder in the repository webapp dir
#    e.g. ./webapps/gpModuleRepository/about
# 2) update the WEB-INF/web.xml file
#    <servlet-mapping>
#        <servlet-name>jspservlet</servlet-name>
#        <url-pattern>/about/*</url-pattern>
#    </servlet-mapping>
#
# 3) add an about.jsp file to this folder 
#    It can be empty. This is a signal to the GP server that there is a details file.
# 4) add an about.yaml file to this folder in the same format as this file
#    Except with only one entry
