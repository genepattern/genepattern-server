# This is an example package descriptor file for the RTutorial module.
# It is more verbose than strictly necessary so that it can illustrate
# all aspects of the r.package.info format.  See README_PACKAGES.md
# for further information.
# You can use a '#' character to indicate a comment line.
# Blank lines are also ignored.

# The following header line is required, though it can be preceded by
# comments and blank lines.
package,requested_version,archive_name,src_URL,Mac_URL,Windows_URL
# The following declare two CRAN packages "pinned" to particular versions.
# Order is important: the 'optparse' package requires the 'getopt' package.
getopt,1.20.0,CRAN
optparse,1.3.2,CRAN
RColorBrewer,1.1-2,CRAN
cluster,2.0.3,CRAN
nlme,3.1-126,CRAN
lattice,0.20-31,CRAN
ape,3.3,CRAN

# The next two are Bioconductor packages.  There's no need to use the BIOC
# tag as the installer will auto-detect this.  There's also no need to 
# declare a version as package versions are fixed and final within a given
# Bioconductor release.
#Biobase
#BiocGenerics


# You can also specify URL-hosted packages.  This is useful for packages
# that aren't hosted in any official repository.  Note that the following
# example does not represent a real package and so it's disabled by the
# use of a comment character.
