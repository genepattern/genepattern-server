            <p>
                Welcome to the public GenePattern server. Use of the GenePattern Web Client, GenePattern server,
                and all modules, pipelines, and suites installed on the server are free for your use. This site
                and results made available through use of this site should not be used for the medical management
                of patients. M.I.T. shall not be held responsible for your use of the site. If you are interested

            </p>

            <p>
                Because we make these modules and pipelines available for free, we cannot bear any risk associated
                with your use of the tools or their results. Further, in order to achieve some protection from
                unexpected and unforeseeable circumstances, MIT must disclaim its liabilities and damages in accordance
                with the laws governing software licensing. Please do not allow this legal requirement to discourage
                your use of the public GenePattern server.
            </p>

            <p>
                MIT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
                INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, AS TO CONFORMITY WITH WHATEVER LITERATURE
                MAY BE ISSUED FROM TIME TO TIME, OR ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
                MIT EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THE SOFTWARE OR ITS COMPLETENESS OR FITNESS
                FOR ANY PURPOSE. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A REPRESENTATION MADE OR WARRANTY
                GIVEN BY M.I.T. THAT THE PRACTICE BY YOU OF THE LICENSE GRANTED HEREUNDER SHALL NOT INFRINGE THE
                PATENT RIGHTS, COPYRIGHTS, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF M.I.T. OR ANY THIRD PARTY.
            </p>

            <p>
                IN NO EVENT SHALL MIT, OR ITS TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR
                ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                LOSS OF GOODWILL, ECONOMIC DAMAGES, OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER MIT
                SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING.
            </p>

            <p>
                If, by operation of law or otherwise, any of the aforementioned warranty disclaimers are determined
                inapplicable, your sole remedy against MIT, regardless of the form of action, including, but not limited
                to, negligence and strict liability, shall be replacement of the Software with an updated version if one
                exists.

                on this site. We do not share this information with other third parties. We may aggregate and analyze log
                file and database information to determine how the GenePattern software is being used in order to enhance
