        <p>Using a data set that contains known samples, create a model
            (also referred to as a <i>class predictor</i> or <i>classifier</i>)
            that can be used to predict the class of a previously unknown sample.

                <li><b><a href="Prediction_cart.html">CART</a></b> (Breiman et al., 1984)
                    builds <b>C</b>lassification <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>egression <b>T</b>rees.
                    It works by recursively splitting the
                    feature space into a set of non-overlapping regions and then predicting
                    the most likely value of the dependent variable within each region. A
                    classification (or regression) tree represents the set of nested if-then conditions
                    used to predict a categorical dependent (or continuous dependent) variable
                    based on the observed values of the feature variables. CART is vulnerable to
                    overfitting and therefore not commonly used with microarray data.

                <li><b><a href="Prediction_knn.html">K-nearest-neighbors (KNN)</a></b> classifies an unknown sample by assigning
                    it the phenotype label most frequently represented among the k nearest
                    known samples (Golub and Slonim et al., 1999). In GenePattern, an analyst can
                    select a weighting factor for the 'votes' of the nearest neighbors. For example, one
                    might weight the votes by the reciprocal of the distance between neighbors.
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="Prediction_pnn.html">Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)</a></b> calculates the probability
                    that an unknown sample belongs to a given set of known phenotype classes
                    (Lu et al., 2005; Specht, 1990). The contribution of each known sample
                    to the phenotype class of the unknown sample follows a Gaussian distribution.
                    PNN can be considered as a Gaussian-weighted KNN classifier - known samples
                    close to the unknown sample have a greater influence on the predicted class
                    of the unknown sample. <br /><br />
                    <b>PNN is not on the GenePattern public server.</b> The PNN modules require the Windows operating system. To use PNN, install the GenePattern server and the PNN modules on a Windows machine.
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="Prediction_svm.html">Support Vector Machines (SVM)</a></b> is designed for multiple class classification
                    (Rifkin et al., 2003). The algorithm creates a binary SVM classifier for
                    each class by computing a maximal margin hyperplane that separates the
                    given class from all other classes; that is, the hyperplane with maximal
                    distance to the nearest data point. The binary classifiers are then combined
                    into a multiclass classfier. For an unknown sample, the assigned class
                    is the one with the largest margin.
                </li>
                <li><b><a href="Prediction_wv.html">Weighted Voting</a></b> (Slonim et al., 2000) classifies an unknown sample
                    using a simple weighted voting scheme. Each gene in the classifier 'votes'
                    for the phenotype class of the unknown sample. A gene's vote is weighted
                    by how closely its expression correlates with the differentiation between
                    phenotype classes in the training data set.
